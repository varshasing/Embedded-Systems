# EC535: Intro to Embedded Systems

This repository is a personal copy of my notes and solutions for EC535: Introduction to Embedded Systems, at Boston University.

_Definition_: embedded system: special-purpose computer system designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions, often with computing constraints

## Homeworks
Homeworks are assigned on Tusedays or Thursdays and typically due a week later

### Programming assignments
 C (or C++) knowledege is necessary
- Unix/Linux experience is helpful

### Reading assignments
These are essential to better understand why we need embedded systems and how todesign them with best practices.

#### Homework Skills Overview:
- Homework 1: Makefile, I/O handling, bit manipulation (endianness, xor cipher), type conversions, linked list

## Labs
- individual labs on emulator for labs 1-3
- labs on boards for lab 4 and project (lab 5)
- Arm-based development boards running Linux, but other programmable platforms may also be permitted

## Notes
- Lecture 1: Overview, challenges in design, design methodologies
- Lecture 2: Assumptions on HW and SW, concurrency and parallelism
